  const prompt = `You are a geopolitical risk analyst. Analyze this event and determine its impact on ${asset.name} risk.

**EVENT:**
${event.title}
${event.description}

**CURRENT RISK LEVEL:** ${asset.currentRiskScore}/10

**ANALYSIS SUMMARY:**
${analysis.impacts.map(i => `- ${i.order.toUpperCase()}: ${i.description}`).join('\n')}

**YOUR TASK:**
Read the event carefully and determine:

1. **Direction**: Should risk INCREASE, DECREASE, or stay NEUTRAL?
   - INCREASE if: Supply disruption, conflict escalation, production shutdown, sanctions, political instability
   - DECREASE if: Resolution, increased production, stability, trade agreements, positive developments
   - NEUTRAL if: Minor news with no clear impact

2. **Magnitude**: How much should it change? (0-10 scale)
   - 0-2: Negligible (minor news, limited scope)
   - 3-4: Moderate (affects one region/company)
   - 5-6: Significant (major company/region affected)
   - 7-8: Severe (global supply concerns)
   - 9-10: Critical (existential threat, war, complete shutdown)

3. **Component Scores** (0-10 each):
   - Supply Disruption: How much is physical supply affected?
   - Market Sentiment: How will investors react?
   - Company Exposure: Are major companies directly impacted?
   - Geopolitical Severity: How severe is the political/military situation?
   - Historical Precedent: How does this compare to past events?

**EXAMPLES:**
- "Pipeline temporarily shut after security incident" ‚Üí INCREASE by 6-7 (supply disruption, uncertainty)
- "Mine strike resolved after 3 days" ‚Üí DECREASE by 3-4 (production resumes)
- "OPEC maintains quotas" ‚Üí NEUTRAL or slight DECREASE by 1-2 (stability)
- "War escalates in major oil region" ‚Üí INCREASE by 9-10 (severe disruption)

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Read the event carefully - don't just use keywords
- Pipeline shutdown = INCREASE risk (supply disruption!)
- Strike/conflict = INCREASE risk
- Resolution/agreement = DECREASE risk
- Think about the real-world impact on supply and prices
